    "overview": "Concrete often suffers from brittleness, low tensile strength, and shrinkage cracks. Synthetic Fibre, made from micro polyester and polypropylene, significantly enhances concrete performance by improving crack resistance, increasing tensile strength, and ensuring better bonding. It is specifically designed for projects facing repeated stress, temperature variations, and exposure to moisture. This fibre reinforcement is extensively used in industrial flooring, precast structures, tunnel linings, and road pavements to increase the durability and flexibility of concrete. </br></br> Recron® 3s can add muscle to concrete.  A specialty secondary reinforcement additive, Recron® 3s adds toughness and tensile strength to concrete, while helping resist shrinkage and cracking. It also bonds better with the mix, thanks to a unique triangular cross section and dimensional stability. <br><br>Developed after extensive research at the Reliance Technology Centre, Recron® 3s has been widely used in a variety of applications. You can be sure that it will add value to the special structures you build. <br><br>Accredited by leading industry bodies such as BIS, CPWD, PWD, MES, Railways, CRRI, IRC and NHAI.",

These natural fibers are derived from renewable plant-based sources and offer several key benefits when incorporated into asphalt. When cellulose fiber pellets are added to asphalt, they improve the overall stability and durability of the pavement. One of the primary advantages is their ability to reduce binder draindown in <b>Stone Matrix Asphalt</b> Mixes. Rutting is the formation of grooves or depressions on the surface of the road, usually caused by the repetitive stress from vehicle traffic, especially in hot weather. Cellulose fibers help distribute the load more evenly across the surface, reducing the likelihood of permanent deformation.</p><br /><p>About Stone Matrix Asphalt:<b> Stone Matrix Asphalt</b> (SMA) was developed in Germany in 1960s and is considered to be highly rut resistant bituminous course, both for binder and wearing courses, for heavy traffic roads. SMA is a tough, stable and a rut resistant mixture which is based on the concept of coarse aggregate skeleton, achieving stone on stone contact. This skeleton provides strength and durability to SMA and enables it to remain healthy for at least 10 - 12 years. </p>",

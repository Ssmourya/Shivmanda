    "overview": "Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA), also known as asphalt stone mastic is a type of asphalt blend comprising a carefully balanced mix of coarse aggregates, filler, and binder. It usually includes a stabilizing asphalt additive, commonly known as a drainage inhibitor that prevents the binder from separating from the aggregate. This results in a resilient and durable pavement surface. History - SMA originated in Germany during the mid-1960s and demonstrated remarkable efficiency in enduring wear and standing up to the challenges posed by studded tires. Due to its exceptional performance, it was officially standardized on a national level in 1984. Subsequently, SMA asphalt gained widespread adoption across Europe and globally.",

    "description": "Stone Matrix Asphalt or asphalt mastic serves both wearing and intermediate pavement layers. The recommended minimum course thickness ranges from 3.5 to 4 times the maximum aggregate size. For heavy traffic, coarser asphalt mixtures like 0/11 and 0/12.5 mm are popular, but they come with trade-offs such as reduced noise reduction and antiskid properties, along with higher permeability. The composition of the coarse aggregate fraction significantly impacts asphalt mastic quality. Achieving optimal gap-gradation involves reducing the finer fractions while increasing the coarsest ones. Higher coarse aggregate content leads to increased air voids and more binder. Adjustments to air voids should not primarily rely on changing binder content, but rather on aggregate fraction gradations. Corrective coefficients dependent on aggregate density are advisable for binder content adjustments. For more information, view Stone Matrix Asphalt explained.",
